        My favorite movie is Alpha and Omega. It is an animated movie from 2010. 
        I like it because the characters are well-written and the story is very interesting. 
        It's also about wolves, and wolves are my favorite animals mainly because of this movie. 
        Despite it being a bit over 10 years old, I still like to sit down every so often and rewatch it over a long weekend. 
        The actor Justin Long is the voice of one of the main characters, Humphrey.</p>
