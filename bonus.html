        <p>Orange Geranium & Otis are a dynamic duo. Formed after the Great Floral Shop Robbery of 1997, these 
            two warriors of justice fight crime, one seed and one flower at a time. Orange Geranium is a florist 
            by day but a hero by night, who goes by the name Orion Green. Otis is Octavian Sigmund, who is a daytime 
            vet and Orange's animal-loving sidekick. Both have dedicated their lives to fighting crimes against 
            the environment.
