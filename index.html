        <h3>My favorite food is spaghetti!</h3>
        <p>My favorite food is spaghetti, especially <b>homemade</b> spaghetti! Ever since I was young, spaghetti has
            always been a staple dish. You can make spaghetti with meatballs or without, but for me, meatballs 
            are a <b>must.</b> On a cold winter's day or a long day at work or school, spaghetti is the <b>perfect</b> 
            dish to have for dinner!

                </li></ol>
            <li><b>Make</b> simple print programs, for loops, etc</li>
                <ol><li>This should also help acquaint you with the syntax as well</li></ol>
            <li><b>Learn</b> about data structures and how they work in code</li>
                <ol><li>Data structures are algorithms that can help make your code much more efficient</li></ol>
            <li><b>Stick</b> with it and challenge yourself!</li>
