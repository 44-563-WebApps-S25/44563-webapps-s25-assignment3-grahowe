        <h3>My favorite food is spaghetti!</h3>
        <p>My favorite food is spaghetti, especially <b>homemade</b> spaghetti! Ever since I was young, spaghetti has
            always been a staple dish. You can make spaghetti with meatballs or without, but for me, meatballs 
            are a <b>must.</b> On a cold winter's day or a long day at work or school, spaghetti is the <b>perfect</b> 
            dish to have for dinner!
